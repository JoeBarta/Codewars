Codewars Kata's

_Katas is the name the use for the small coding challenges, if you want the whole Japanese meaning google it dawg._

## Difficulty ranking are by _kyu's_

Kyu rating 1 kyu being the most difficult, 8 kyu being the easiest

_Note, a lot of these challenges I tried to make as fancy and simple 1 liners .. edge-casey stuff is ignored if not required_
